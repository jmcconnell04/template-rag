# If you have other specific runtime data files in other rag_files subdirectories (like 'data'),
# you might want to ignore specific patterns or all contents if they are purely runtime generated.
# For example, to ignore all files directly under rag_files/data/ but not the directory itself:
# rag_files/data/*
# !rag_files/data/.gitkeep 
# However, be cautious with broad wildcards if you intend to commit some example files there.
